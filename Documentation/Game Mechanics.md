# Game Mechanics

### Project Page: *https://prokschf.github.io/OpenMobileTBS_V1/*


## Turns

The game is turn based. Every player in the game gets one turn after another in a set order.

There is a separate event at the beginning of each turn not associated with any player but for "world events"

## Game Map

The game map is modeled after a network (graph) consisting of nodes and edges. 

**Nodes** represent a "field" where any game object can reside at a given turn.

**Edges** represent possible movement between nodes.
